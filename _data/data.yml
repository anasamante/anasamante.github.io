    title: Career Profile
    summary: >
      Senior QA Automation Engineer with 10+ years of experience across web, mobile, and API testing,
      including 5+ years specializing in test automation with Cypress and Playwright.
      I've worked across startups and enterprise environments in Argentina and Spain,
      adapting to different stacks, teams, and product domains.
      My expertise covers functional, regression, integration, exploratory, cross-browsing, and mobile testing,
      as well as database and web services (API) validation.
      Beyond executing tests, I contribute to building and improving QA processes and workflows,
      collaborating closely with development and product teams from early planning through release.
      I work best in agile, cross-functional teams where quality is treated as a shared responsibility, not just a final gate.
